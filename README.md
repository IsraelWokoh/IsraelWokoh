Hi, I’m Israel. That's me in the profile picture.

## About me

- **BSc Mathematics with Actuarial Science** from Queen Mary, University of London. Graduated September 2021.

- My skills and interests mostly lie in **mathematics and programming**. Unsurprisingly, my main strengths are **computational thinking and logical deconstruction**.

- Python and R featured in my degree syllabus, but I've done some extracurricular courses for data science and programming that covered **Python, SQL and R**, including a 12-week software development bootcamp. Also, I'm certified as a **Microsoft Office Specialist for Excel**.

### Fun facts

- Former **Rubik's Cube hobbyist**, though I never broke the 10-second mark. Also did 4×4 and 5×5.
- Used to enjoy watching Channel 4's _Countdown_ after school as a child, especially to practise my mental arithmentic.

## What I'm looking for

- Seeking **London-based entry-level positions in software development or data science**. In truth, any role that's at least somewhat mathematical and/or computer scientific would be a great fit.

- Prospective employers and anyone else who somehow stumbled here, feel free to look around! This collection will change over time as I modify/improve existing mini-projects, or come up with new ones.
	- There may not be much to see right now, but I hope this at least serves as evidence of an aptitude for and interest in those aforementioned roles.
