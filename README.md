Hi, I’m Israel. That's me in the profile pic.

- Graduated in Sep 2021 with **BSc Mathematics with Actuarial Science** from Queen Mary, University of London.

- My skills and interests lie in **mathematics, data science, programming, and (by extension) computational/logical thinking**. _Fun fact: I used to do the Rubik's Cube (including 4×4 and 5×5) as a hobby. Couldn't break the 10-second mark, though._

- I've done some extracurricular Data Science courses that covered **Python, SQL and R**. Python and R also featured in my degree syllabus. Also, I'm certified as a **Microsoft Office Specialist for Excel**.

- I'm currently searching for a **graduate/entry-level job in London** as a **software developer**, **data analyst/engineer**, or anything adjacent to those roles.

- To prospective employers (and anyone else who stumbled here), feel free to look around. This collection will change over time as I modify existing mini-projects, improve them, or come up with new ones.
